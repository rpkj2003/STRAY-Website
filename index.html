                            <p>Developed by <strong>BlueTwelve Studio</strong>, Stray is a game where you follow an orange tabby cat through a dystopian world that is full of life, but not in the way you'd expect. Pounce, jump, and run as you avoid pitfalls, traps, and enemies, all while searching for your way back home to your feline family.</p>
                <br><br>
                            <h3 class="mb-lg-5 mb-4">What's at stake?</h3>

                            <p>Not only is your life (or lives) at stake, the entire population you encounter relies on your actions. As you progress further into the game, you uncover the mysteries of the overgrown land you find yourself in, all the while deadly zurks, sentinels, cliffs, and of course, water, stand in your way. Try your best to not get caught, or you may as well kiss your nine lives goodbye.</p>

                            <p>The journey begins as you and your littermates get ready for bed during a thunder storm under a concrete overhang. Upon waking up, you begin your journey in search of food, water, and to quinch your thirst for exploration. However, following your littermates of a rust pipeline, it collapses, resulting in you falling a signifcant height, separated from your family. Your job as you wake back up is to find your way back home! Following your adventure, you encounter all of sorts of interesting figures: robots. These robots have personalities, and they send you on quests, with the hopes of either personal gain, or to help you along your way. During your adventure, one particular robot becomes your greatest friend/ally, and his name is B-12. Continuing on your adventure, you both unravel the mysterious of this strange world, escaping from your enemies to get to the final challenge: opening the city walls. By sacrificing B-12, you are able to venture beyond the city limits, and return to nature.</p>

                            <h3 class="col-lg-6 col-12">Ending</h3>

                            <p>The game ends as you finally reach the high tech facility with the controls to open the city walls to the rest of the world; you are what changes the future of this once unknown robot civilization. However, no ending is ever satisfying without sacrifice, as B-12 says his last goodbyes, he sacrifices himself to override the processors capable of opening the wall to city 99. As the city is shown a new light, our feline friend exits the once forgotten city, and the game ends with us returning to the wild, continuing our search for our furry family.</p>

                                <p>“By placing this magnetic yet unknowable creature of nature into a tightly controlled, man-made science-fiction dystopia, Stray highlights something that any cat person already knows: you can never really tame a cat. There’s always something a little wild about them, and they bring that wildness wherever they go.”</p>

                                            <p>The OST, originally composed by Yann van der Cruyssen, lasts about 3 hours, implementing mainly electronic elements to support the cyberpunk world we are set in. A good number of tracks are left spacey or airy, which in turn adds to the empty feeling the player may feel during these experiences. There are percussive and orchestral elements present, from a chasing scene to a silent escape scene, each with their own unique sound, perfectly immulating the tone or mood the visual aspects of the game are creating for us.</p>

The audio is heavily electronified, however it intentially resembles a human speaking through all of the clutter. This was most likely done to provide comfort or familiarity to the player, in a way that makes it easier to trust in them or understand them more.</p>

<p>This is the sound of a robot NPC who's annoyed or argumentative. The audio in his voice is much more robotic, not resebling a human other than the volume and melody of his voice when we may be frustrated. This helps support the idea that the robots became more civilized as time went on, but at the end of the day, they're still robots. The movement of pitch is much more spiratic, going in completely different octaves at incredbile speed, helping to showcase the art of robotic technology. This can provide humor or light-heartedness for the player, helping create a more intriguing experience.</p>

                <p>Here's the entirety of the game, but you can end around 3:36.


                    The visual design of Stray is so unique in that during its' development, they used a real life orange tabby named Murtaugh, and tracked his behaviors and movements for the design choices of the cats!</p>

               <p>The characters are differently animated with the same desgin limitations, as they each have their own personalities that add to the player experience. The spiraticness of the zurks, the urgency yet calmness in the robots, and the realistic movements from the cats all support the fictatious environment set for the player. The environmet is absolutely stunning, with fantastic shading and precise detailing to every aspect. There is no corner that hasn't been thoroughly thought out and effective for player experience.</p>

               <p style="margin-bottom: 200px;">The color schemes are dark yet warm, vibrant yet dull, and everything in between. The reddish hue of the town versus the green sickly pallete of the sewers are contrasted in such a way that really feels like you've entered a new world, even though you are still within thew walls of City 99. Once you reach the end of the game, we see a similar color pattern to the one we saw at the beginning of the game, with sunlight enshrouding the city below, and vibrant fauna flourishing in the background.</p>

               <h3 class="mb-3">Trial and Error</h3>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">One of the game's main functions built in is the art of trial and error, or getting a do over in your situation. Allowing this freedom gives the player a sense of ease as death isn't as much as a reality to us. This function allows us to strategize, practice, and learn from our mistakes, until eventually we succeed the given puzzle. Without this aspect, the player would be much more anxious about their moves, which isn't very cat-like at all!</p>

                <h3 class="mb-3">Psychoanalysis</h3>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">In the game, the player encounters a lot of disturbing imagery, such as the nest of the zurks or the sewers. Although these environments may provide discomfortness and anxiety, the player is gifted with going back and forth between areas, as well as the previously stated trial and error function. With these tools, the initial shock of the surroundings dissopates, effectively helping us conquer our fears.</p>
                                
                
                    <h3 class="col-12">Mirror Reflection</h3>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">While playing through, there is no question that the varying qualities of environments can be related to the quality of life we live now. Our world is so unique in that we have similar situations as portrayed in the slum, the sewers, the labratory, the city. All of these things can reflect the captivity of our lives within a smaller scope of what could be, and as the city walls open, we finally feel free from the restrictions of power, ready to take on new adventures.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <h3 class="col-12">The Reality Effect</h3>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">The reality effect is essentially where little details in the game surrounding you are given effort into fruition, that provide an unnecessary element yet still increases the effectiveness of the moment. There are TONS of moments. All of the little conversations that you can have with the many different characters, that may not influence progress, but just to get into the immersion of the story you are set in. The effort to go above and beyond is without question apparent, with ever nook and cranny given much thought to upholding the standard the game has set for itself.</p>

                                <p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">The world of Stray is well-deserving of its' award for Game of the Year in 2022, due to the exceeding expectations in all aspects of the game: visuals, audio, storyline, characters, details, etc. I've personally never encountered a game quite like this, though other games may try to replicate what a master piece  of a game this is. I implore everyone to at least watch the game played to gain a perspective on it. It's a journey that fills your hearts in ways that you will wonder why you've never experienced it before.
